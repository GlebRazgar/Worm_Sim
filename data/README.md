SI 2:
NUMBER OF SCORED SYNAPSES BETWEEN PAIRS OF CELLS: SYNAPSE ADJACENCY MATRICES, HERMAPHRODITE AND MALE, CHEMICAL SYNAPSES AND GAP JUNCTIONS.  
**For chemical connections**
rows: presynaptic cell; columns: post-synaptic cell.  
The body of the table gives the number of synapses scored between each pair of cells.  
NB: This matrix differs from the Connectome Adjacency Matrices (Suppplementary Information 5) in not taking into account the sizes of synapses and in showing only connections scored on electron micrographs.  It does not include any connections inserted by extrapolation.  Thus there are cells showing no connection here that are connected in the Connectome Adjacency Matrices.  Also note, there are more edges in this table than the total number of synapses scored (synapse lists, Supplementary Information 3).  This is because polyads are listed here more than once (once for each postsynaptic cell).
