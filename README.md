** Building a full simulation of a worm from scratch**

Why worm?
- Its has a small, wierd neuron types which would give you the first principle knowledge behind what it takes to segment, and simulate an organism.

Why not a different, more mammal like animal?
- Because C.Elegans are compute agile due to the small number of neurons.
