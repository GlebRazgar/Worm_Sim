** Building a full simulation of a worm from scratch**

Why worm?
- Its has a small, wierd neuron types which would give me the first principle knowledge behind what it takes to segment, and simulate an organism.

Why not a transformer algorithm which is more tangibly useful?
- Because the transformer will be more applicable and give me opportunity to apply to EON, but not give me ground level understanding of all the challenges in the segmentationa and mapping proccess.

Why Not a smaller segment of a different animal?
- Because it wont capture all the issues of a full simulation. If you model the full organism that will just be rediculously expensive.
